I was born and raised in Nashville, TN. I am a curious individual avidly drawn to exploring and figuring out all things in the mechanical world. Currently, I'm a full time student in Mechanical Engineering. I also love skateboarding, true-crime documentaries, room temperature water, dharma meditation talks and working with my hands to create things.
