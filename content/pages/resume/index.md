<!-- The media querry in the CSS sheet wont work due to inline styling. Inline 
styling must stay until the PDF can be converted without the use
of inline styling as it doesn't hold its style - may need to use a different converter - or
properly hook up the style sheet with the pdf converter, however, it inherits all other styles. 
Can't figure out why its not inheriting the 'float: right' argument from the CSS sheet. -->
