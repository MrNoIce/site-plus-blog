description: An application to communicate infrastructure issues to the city built with reactjs
---



A single page, responsive, CRUD web app built for raising critical infrastructure defects to the officials that have the power to resolve them. I developed the app using react.js, styling with bootstrap, and a simple JSON server for the backend. I used two APIâ€™s, one is the Cloudinary API for image upload and storage and the second is the MapBox API for acquiring coordinates for the issue form and the interactive map.
