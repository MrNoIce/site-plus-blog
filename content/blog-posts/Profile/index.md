This site is built with Gatsby. A React-based, GraphQL powered, static site generator. It uses powerful preconfiguration to build a website that uses only static files for incredibly fast page loads, service workers, code splitting, server-side rendering, intelligent image loading, asset optimization, and data prefetching. I chose Gatsby so I could learn something new and get some experience with GraphQl.
