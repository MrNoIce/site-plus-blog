One of my favorite things I learned about when building this site is the ability to add components directly into markdown pages with MDXProvider.

Here is an example of using a form component directly in the mdx page

```md
- Picture/mirror hanging
- Moving items like plants, furniture, and appliances
- Gutter cleaning and repair
- Internet connectivity with network issues and IOT devices
- And just about any little annoyances that needs taken care of

### Please fill out the form below and I will respond as soon as possible.

<HomeRequestForm />

### I will travel up to 30 miles from Nashville - Any further will need to be discussed

*I do* ***not*** *take-on full home remodels of any type. I do, however, have trusted individuals I recommend for larger projects and can help to advise you on the best course of action for your needs.*

```

And here is how MDXProvider is used in place of dangerouslySetInnerHTML. This is how Gatsby accesses the available components to use in MDX.


```js
return (
    <>
      <Helmet>
        <html lang={"en"} />
        <style type="text/css">{""}</style>
        <body className={""} />
      </Helmet>

      <div className="viewport">
        <div className="viewport-top">
          <Header
            siteTitle={data.site.siteMetadata.title}
            siteDescription={data.site.siteMetadata.description}
          />
          <div className="site-main">
            <MDXProvider components={shortcodes}>{children}</MDXProvider>
          </div>
        </div>
        <footer>
          <Bio />
        </footer>
      </div>
    </>
  )

```

This site is built with Gatsby. A React-based, GraphQL powered, static site generator. It uses powerful preconfiguration to build a website that uses only static files for incredibly fast page loads, service workers, code splitting, server-side rendering, intelligent image loading, asset optimization, and data prefetching. I chose Gatsby so I could learn something new and get some experience with GraphQl.
