description: An application to search used car listings built with Python/Django
---

#### this is it

Here, I'll refresh my discription of how I built the app - Add in some images of the code and talk about what its doing.

I wanted to search the entire internet of cars for sale without having to navigate through promoted vehicles and websites. I used Python and Django’s web templates to interact with my SQLite database. I also wanted to use an external API to gather the data from and store it in my own db for reference. I’ve built this app that uses MarketCheck’s Api. Their bots crawl all of the used car listings and place them in an API.
